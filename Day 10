LISTS --> holds multiple values in one variable
--> It is a collection of items.
--> can be of different data types (integers, strings, floats, even other lists).
1. Creating Lists
--> holds multiple values in one variable
2. Accessing Elements (Indexing)
--> starts at 0
--> Negative Indexing starts at -1 from the end
3) Slicing
--> fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0:2]) => apple, banana
4) Changing Elements
--> ordered, mutable, allow duplicates.
ex:- fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
     fruits[1] = "mango"
    print(fruits) => ['apple', 'mango', 'cherry']
