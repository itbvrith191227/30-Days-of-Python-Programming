_LOOPS_
=>repeating the code without writing it many times.
*while :- repeats till the condition is true
*for :- loops over a sequence(string,list,range of nums)
*looping through a string :- for char in "Python":
                                print(char)
ex:- 1-> count = 1
         while count <= 5:
               print("Count is:", count)
               count += 1
    2-> for i in range(5):
             print("Number:", i)
    3-> for char in "Python":
            print(char)
