17) Create a dictionary for a book:
title, author, year, price
and print each key-value pair.
book = {"title":"Atomic Habits",
        "author":"James Clear",
        "year":2018, 
        "price:":149}
print(book)
18) Add a new key "publisher" and remove "price".
book["publisher"] = "Penguin"
book.pop("price:")
print(book)
19) Print only the keys and only the values separately.
print(book.keys())
print(book.values())
