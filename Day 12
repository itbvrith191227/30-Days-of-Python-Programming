**Tuples (Immutable Lists)**
--> similar to lists but are unchangeable
--> are faster and used for fixed data
--> are written using parentheses () or just commas.
--> must include a trailing comma for a single element =>single = (42,)  not_tuple = (42) 
--> Immutability applies to the tuple object itself 
--> but a tuple can contain mutable items (like lists),those inner objects can still change
----> fixed date => months, coordinates etc
1. Creating Tuples
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)
names = ("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
single = ("one",)   
2. Accessing Elements
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(numbers[0])   => 1
print(numbers[-1])  => 4
3. Tuples Are Immutable
-- You cannot change or remove elements
numbers = (1, 2, 3)
# numbers[0] = 10 ❌  (Error: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment)
4. Tuple Operations
t1 = (1, 2, 3)
t2 = (4, 5)
print(t1 + t2)      => (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(t1 * 2)       => (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)
print(len(t1))      => 3
print(3 in t1)      => True
5. Tuple Unpacking
You can assign tuple values to multiple variables easily
person = ("Shravya", 22, "India")
name, age, country = person
print(name)
print(age)
print(country)
